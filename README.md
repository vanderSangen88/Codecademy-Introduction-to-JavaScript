### 1.1. Introduction to JavaScript

#### 1.1.1. Introduction
JavaScript is a widely used web-based programming language that powers the dynamic behavior on most websites, including this one.

In this lesson, you will learn about data types and built-in methods, essential knowledge for all aspiring JavaScript developers. When you finish, you'll know how to write programs that solve mathematical expressions, compute the length of a word, and generate random numbers.

This lesson covers the building blocks of JavaScript. Make sure to take notes and pace yourself. This foundation will set you up for understanding more complex concepts later.

#### 1.1.2. Console
Before you learn about data types and methods, you need to know how to print values to the console. The console is a tool that developers use to record the output of their JavaScript programs.

The ```console.log()``` command is used to print, or log, text to the console. Consider the following example:
```js
console.log("Hello!");
```

In this example, ```Hello!``` is logged to the console. Notice, we denote the end of the line with a semicolon. Although your code will usually run as intended without a semicolon, it is best practice to always include one to ensure your code works as expected in situations when it does need one.

You'll see in the next exercise that you can put any data type inside the parentheses to print it to the console.

#### 1.1.3. Data Types
Data types are the building blocks of all languages and essential pieces of any program.

Below are examples of four primitive data types that lay the foundation for all JavaScript programs. Primitive data types, as their name implies, are the simplest built-in forms of data.
```js
console.log('New York City');
console.log(40.7);
console.log(true);
console.log(null);
```
In the example above, the computer logs each of the four primitive data types to the console. The types include:
- *Strings* — Any grouping of keyboard characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by single quotes (```'Hello'```) or double quotes (```"World!"```). In the example above, ```'New York City'``` is a string.
- *Numbers* — Any number, including numbers with decimals: ```4```, ```1516```, ```.002```, ```23.42```. In the example above, ```40.7``` is a number.
- *Booleans* — Either `true` or `false`, with no quotations. In the example above, `true` is a boolean.
- *Null* — Can only be `null`. It represents the absence of value.

Let's review: a string is any grouping of words, a number's a number, null is the absence of value, and a boolean is a ghostly Halloween costume. Or no, that's false! It's either true or false.

#### 1.1.4. Math Operators
Don't worry! Math doesn't need to be your strong-suit to learn JavaScript. However, there are operators you'll need to know to make useful programs.

JavaScript supports the following math *operators*:
1. Add: `+`
2. Subtract: `-`
3. Multiply: `*`
4. Divide: `\`

These all work how you might guess:
```js
console.log(3 + 4); // Equals 7
console.log(5 - 1); // Equals 4
console.log(4 * 2); // Equals 8
console.log(9 / 3); // Equals 3
```
In the example above, each line uses a different mathematical operator to log a value to the console.

#### 1.1.5. Properties

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. An instance is an individual case (or object) of a data type.

JavaScript will save a new piece of data, like `'Hello'`, as a string instance in the computer's memory. Another example, the number `40.7`, is stored as an instance of the number data type.

An instance, like the string `'Hello'`, has additional information attached to it.

For example, every string instance has a property called `length` that stores the number of characters in it. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

```js
console.log('Hello'.length);
```
In the example above, the value saved to the `length` property is retrieved from the string, `'Hello'`. The program prints `5` to the console, because `Hello` has five characters in it.
